# Detailed view of the game

The project has been developed as a way to test soft skills, thus it is only one time play for every user.

## Completion of the game

- The game is meant to test the soft skills, thus keeping user stuck on level forever with no form of rescue is futile.

- To avoid this *Special actions:* **skip** and **End Game**, are available at each stage so user can skip the stage by discarding the points or end the game if required.

## General Instructions for the game are as follows:

- The purpose of this game set is to evaluate your soft skills

- We recommend completing all games in one sitting, as the game is designed to be played only once

- Points are awarded for correct answers and time taken to solve each game

- The timer will not be visible on screen

- In the event of an emergency such as a power outage, technical difficulties, or network issues, you may resume the game from where you left off

- Timer will continue on the server but your progress won't be lost

- Please be attentive to all information presented in the game

- If you find yourself at a dead end, you can choose to review the previous stage, which may provide clues to help you progress past the current stage

- If necessary, you have the option to skip a stage, though this will result in forfeiting any potential points for that stage

- You may end the game at any time, regardless of what stage you are on and receive results till there

## Motive

Q1 to Q3 are there to check users attention, others are to assess Emotional Intelligence.

There are 3 methods to check Emotional Intelligence: "self-reporting, other-reporting, and ability testing".

While conducting this game, **Self reporting** is the most suitable method to do so.

Initially we ask some obvious Questions that user should be able to answer easily if they paid attention to story.

This sets up the pace for our crucial questions that are in pair (4 and 8) and (5 and 7).

(4 and 8) asks the Question on whether user got to know about  Ghost. Whether they do or not is up to them but a difference in answer suggests users incapacity to understand their emotion about the Ghost.


With these Qs we attempting to assess Emotional Intelligence of the user.
